## Key Points
- The primary focus is the estimation and inference for $\beta(t)$. For the theory part, the key result is consistency and convergence rate of $\hat{\beta}(t)$.
- Do not include penalty in the theory part. Then include penalty in the computation algorithm.
- Do not estimate $b_i(t)$ as it requires dense individual observations.
- Try multiplier bootstrap to estimate the covariance function of $\hat{\beta}(t)$. If the simulation results are good, then study the consistency of the covariance estimator.
- Find newer data on UCI.

### Varying coefficient model for the outcome process $Y(t)$

### Proportional intensity model for the conditional intensity function of $N(t)$ given $\overline{O}(t-)$
