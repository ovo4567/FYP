## Key Points
- The primary focus is the estimation and inference for $\beta(t)$. For the theory part, the key result is consistency and convergence rate of $\hat{\beta}(t)$.

### Varying coefficient model for the outcome process $Y(t)$

### Proportional intensity model for the conditional intensity function of $N(t)$ given $\overline{O}(t-)$
